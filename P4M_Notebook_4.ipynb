These packages extend the capability of Python by defining new types which are highly optimized for floating-point and fixed-size integer computation.  They also extend the capability of Python by introducing new list-like types that allow multi-dimensional arrays (like matrices) and allow \"broadcasting\" -- the seemingly-simultaneous application of functions to all terms of such an array.\n",

For matrices, or other multidimensional arrangements, one might wish for a list which is \"doubly-indexed\" -- something where the entries would be retrieved with a command like `L[1,2]` (for something in the 1st row and 2nd column).  It's possible to make this work in plain Python by using lists of lists.  For example, if `M = [[1,2],[3,4]]` is a list of lists, then you can retrieve numbers with commands like `M[0][1]`.  But this gets a bit cumbersome and is not optimized for typical operations on matrices.\n",

        "3.  If you roll ten fair 6-sided dice, you expect the total to be 35, on average.  The minimum total would be 10 and the maximum would be 60.  Use numpy to create a array with 50 rows and 10 columns of random dice rolls (random integers between 1 and 6).  By summing rows, create an array of numbers between 10 and 60.  What is the average of this array (a number between 10 and 60)?  What is the standard deviation of this array?  (Use the `np.std` function for standard deviation.)  Use numpy functions throughout -- no loops please!  \n",

        "4.  Define a function `matrix_pow(M,e)` which takes as input a *square* matrix `M` and a natural number `e`.  The output should be the result of matrix multiplication, with `M` multiplied by itself `e` times.  When `e` is zero, the function should output the identity matrix `np.eye(s)` where `s` is the number of rows (or columns) of `M`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  The matrix exponential is defined by the same Taylor series as the usual exponential function, but one allows square matrices as inputs instead of just numbers.  Define a function `matrix_exp(M)` which computes the matrix exponential of `M` using the first 20 terms of the (familiar) series, and uses the `matrix_pow` function from the previous question."

The now-classic book in the field is Edward Tufte's [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi), but you can find much earlier works by the best-named statistician [Playfair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Playfair) or the beautiful but vexing *Semiology of Graphics* by Jacques Bertin.\n",

The first is [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), which has the same number of letters and syllables as [manbearpig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ManBearPig).  Matplotlib is an excellent tool for creating a huge number of \"standard\" graphs and charts.  It works very nicely in Jupyter notebooks, interfaces with numpy, and is very widely supported.\n",

We will use Pillow for \"low-level\" 2-dimensional image manipulation.  Pillow is great when we want to create or modify an image pixel-by-pixel.  It's not so great if we just want to make a graph with some dots, lines, axes, and labels.  \n",

Also [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for a visualization system based on matplotlib, but with more modern styling.  For producing print-ready graphics, I use a strange combination of Python and [TikZ/PGF](http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/all/)."

To use matplotlib's plotting capabilities, we load the matplotlib.pyplot package as plt (just as we loaded numpy as np).  The pyplot part of matplotlib is meant to work like Matlab.

The size on your screen may appear different, because your browser is smart.  If you want to manually set the figure size, you should do this before everything else.  All other `plt` commands in the cell will operate on this figure (the \"state\" of the \"state machine\").

The xlist and ylist are the lists of x-coordinates and y-coordinates... the data which is being plotted.  The `alpha` parameter sets the transparency of the dots, which is very important when there are overlaps!  An alpha value of 1 yields completely opaque dots.  The `c` parameter sets the color of the dots.  Here the dot color is set to `gold`.  Here is a [list of named colors](https://matplotlib.org/examples/color/named_colors.html).  More fun than crayons!  The `s` parameter sets the size of the dots, measured by area.  Here is the [complete list of parameters](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html) that can be passed to the `plt.scatter` function.\n",

        "1.  Use `np.arange` and `np.linspace` to product the same numpy array `array([ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  5.,  6.,  7.,  8.,  9., 10.])`.  \n",

        "2.  Create numpy arrays `xlist` and `ylist`, such that their scatter plot contains 100 evenly spaced points on the unit circle.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Use numpy to create a 10000 by 100 array of numbers, randomly chosen from {0,1}, with the command `R = np.random.choice([0,1], (10000,100))`.  You can think of each entry as a coin-toss, with 0 standing for tails and 1 for heads.  Now sum the rows of this array, to get an array of 10000 numbers between 0 and 100.  Make a histogram of this array to exhibit the [central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem).  Use at least 20 bins.  Try this with other random choices of numbers, e.g., replacing [0,1] by other small lists of numbers.  How is the horizontal center of the histogram peak related to the list of numbers you choose?  Extra time? compare to the normal distribution by overlaying a suitable plt.plot."

        "To understand how this works, it is helpful to understand a bit more about light, computer monitors, and images-as-data.  Light is electromagnetic radiation, and it travels through space in waves.  Light waves with a wavelength of about 400-700 nanometers stimulate cells on our retina, and therefore are *visible*.  Longer wavelength light includes infrared, microwave, and radio waves.  Shorter wavelength light includes ultraviolet and x-rays.\n",
        "\n",
        "For most of us, our retinas contain 3 types of \"cone cells\" which are responsive to different wavelengths of light.  Some are most responsive to light in the low 400 nm range, others to light in the low 500nm range, others in the mid 500nm range.  Signals from these three kinds of cells get passed to the brain, and we are able to distinguish between different wavelengths (in the 400-700nm range) by which cells are more or less activated.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you see light purely in the 400-450 nm range, it looks pretty blue, whereas light at the 650-700 nm range looks pretty red.  A typical red laser pointer shines light that's close to 650nm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your computer monitor contains millions of *pixels* -- extremely tiny these days (often below 100 micrometers square).  Each pixel contains a red, a blue, and a green subpixel.  Each of these subpixels is individually dimmable, and is often set between 0 (completely off) and 255 (completely on).  In this way, each pixel can be black (red = 0, blue = 0, green = 0) or bright pure red (red = 255, blue = 0, green = 0) or white (red = 255, blue = 255, green = 255).\n",
        "\n",
        "To understand how this makes \"white\" or \"yellow\" or all the other colors in the rainbow, you need to understand an *additive* color scheme as well as how light is perceived.  When light of multiple wavelengths hits your retina, your brain perceives a certain color.  In fact, if light of a red wavelength (680nm) and green wavelength (510nm) hits your retina at the same time, your brain will see it exactly the same as light of a yellow wavelength (560nm).  When you look at a bright yellow picture on your computer monitor, your computer is actually shining red and green light at your retina... the red and green dots are just so tiny and closely packed that your brain doesn't know the difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code below creates a 200 by 200 by 3 array of numbers, each between 0 and 255.  But you should think about it as a 200 by 200 array of quadruples of the form `[red value, green value, blue value]`.  Each value can be between 0 and 255 -- it is represented as a np.uint8.\n",
        "\n",
        "This array is then turned into a PIL Image with the `Image.fromarray` function.  Then the PIL function `display` displays the image.  Notice how red+green looks yellow.  Experiment with the red, green, and blue values to see what happens!\n"
