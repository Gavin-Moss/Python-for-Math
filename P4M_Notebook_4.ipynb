These packages extend the capability of Python by defining new types which are highly optimized for floating-point and fixed-size integer computation.  They also extend the capability of Python by introducing new list-like types that allow multi-dimensional arrays (like matrices) and allow \"broadcasting\" -- the seemingly-simultaneous application of functions to all terms of such an array.\n",

A list like `L = [1,2,3]` has a zeroth, first, and second item (or \"element\" or \"entry\"), which can be retrieved with `L[0]` or `L[1]` or `L[2]`.  For matrices, or other multidimensional arrangements, one might wish for a list which is \"doubly-indexed\" -- something where the entries would be retrieved with a command like `L[1,2]` (for something in the 1st row and 2nd column).  It's possible to make this work in plain Python by using lists of lists.  For example, if `M = [[1,2],[3,4]]` is a list of lists, then you can retrieve numbers with commands like `M[0][1]`.  But this gets a bit cumbersome and is not optimized for typical operations on matrices.\n",

        "The visualization of quantitative information is a huge field of study.  The now-classic book in the field is Edward Tufte's [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi), but you can find much earlier works by the best-named statistician [Playfair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Playfair) or the beautiful but vexing *Semiology of Graphics* by Jacques Bertin.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we are going to introduce two tools for visualization.  The first is [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), which has the same number of letters and syllables as [manbearpig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ManBearPig).  Matplotlib is an excellent tool for creating a huge number of \"standard\" graphs and charts.  It works very nicely in Jupyter notebooks, interfaces with numpy, and is very widely supported.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second tool is [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) which is the new and fluffy incarnation of PIL, the Python Imaging Library.  We will use Pillow for \"low-level\" 2-dimensional image manipulation.  Pillow is great when we want to create or modify an image pixel-by-pixel.  It's not so great if we just want to make a graph with some dots, lines, axes, and labels.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Other tools worth consideration are:  [SVGwrite](https://pypi.org/project/svgwrite/) for working with scalable vector graphics and [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) for making very pretty interactive graphics on the web.  Also [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for a visualization system based on matplotlib, but with more modern styling.  For producing print-ready graphics, I use a strange combination of Python and [TikZ/PGF](http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/all/)."

To use matplotlib's plotting capabilities, we load the matplotlib.pyplot package as plt (just as we loaded numpy as np).  The pyplot part of matplotlib is meant to work like Matlab.

So if you start with an array of 100 zeros (as float64s), NumPy will find 6400 consecutive bits of memory in your computer, and set them to represent 100 consecutive zeros (each stored in a 64-bit clump).  \n",

NumPy has already found a perfectly-sized block of memory for your data, and now you are asking NumPy to fit more data in the block.  So NumPy will go out and hunt for a new perfectly-sized block of memory to fit your data... every single time you append.  This will waste resources and make NumPy sad.\n",

You can think of each entry as a coin-toss, with 0 standing for tails and 1 for heads.  Now sum the rows of this array, to get an array of 10000 numbers between 0 and 100.  Make a histogram of this array to exhibit the [central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem).  Use at least 20 bins.  Try this with other random choices of numbers, e.g., replacing [0,1] by other small lists of numbers.  How is the horizontal center of the histogram peak related to the list of numbers you choose?  Extra time? compare to the normal distribution by overlaying a suitable plt.plot."

        "To understand how this works, it is helpful to understand a bit more about light, computer monitors, and images-as-data.  Light is electromagnetic radiation, and it travels through space in waves.  Light waves with a wavelength of about 400-700 nanometers stimulate cells on our retina, and therefore are *visible*.  Longer wavelength light includes infrared, microwave, and radio waves.  Shorter wavelength light includes ultraviolet and x-rays.\n",
        "\n",
        "For most of us, our retinas contain 3 types of \"cone cells\" which are responsive to different wavelengths of light.  Some are most responsive to light in the low 400 nm range, others to light in the low 500nm range, others in the mid 500nm range.  Signals from these three kinds of cells get passed to the brain, and we are able to distinguish between different wavelengths (in the 400-700nm range) by which cells are more or less activated.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you see light purely in the 400-450 nm range, it looks pretty blue, whereas light at the 650-700 nm range looks pretty red.  A typical red laser pointer shines light that's close to 650nm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your computer monitor contains millions of *pixels* -- extremely tiny these days (often below 100 micrometers square).  Each pixel contains a red, a blue, and a green subpixel.  Each of these subpixels is individually dimmable, and is often set between 0 (completely off) and 255 (completely on).  In this way, each pixel can be black (red = 0, blue = 0, green = 0) or bright pure red (red = 255, blue = 0, green = 0) or white (red = 255, blue = 255, green = 255).\n",
        "\n",
        "To understand how this makes \"white\" or \"yellow\" or all the other colors in the rainbow, you need to understand an *additive* color scheme as well as how light is perceived.  When light of multiple wavelengths hits your retina, your brain perceives a certain color.  In fact, if light of a red wavelength (680nm) and green wavelength (510nm) hits your retina at the same time, your brain will see it exactly the same as light of a yellow wavelength (560nm).  When you look at a bright yellow picture on your computer monitor, your computer is actually shining red and green light at your retina... the red and green dots are just so tiny and closely packed that your brain doesn't know the difference.\n",

        "5.  (A little bit of [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography)!)  There's a coded message in the green channel, once it's oriented correctly.  The message is located at y-coordinate 10 and x-coordinates 0,8,16,24,32,etc.  Find this message by using applying the `chr` function to the green values at these locations.  If you want to experiment, the `ord` function converts characters (one-letter strings) to uint8's and the `chr` function converts uint8's to characters, using ASCII code."
